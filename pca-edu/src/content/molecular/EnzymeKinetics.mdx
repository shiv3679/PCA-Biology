# Enzyme Kinetics — turning substrate into story

> How fast does a fly’s enzyme work, what slows it down, and how do we measure it on the bench?

---

## 1 Why care in a *Drosophila* lab? 🪰

* **Metabolism mutants** – *Adh* polymorphisms change ethanol survival; kinetics tells you *how much* faster the “fast” allele burns EtOH.  
* **Signal‐transduction** – MAPK phosphatase mutants alter *k_cat/K_m* for ERK; quantify pathway damping.  
* **Drug screening** – IC₅₀ curves on fly acetylcholinesterase predict insecticide resistance.  
* **Teaching** – one 96-well plate of larval extracts, NADH readout, students see Michaelis–Menten live.

## 2 Core parameters (plain English) 📖

| Symbol | What it really is | Easy metaphor |
|--------|------------------|---------------|
| **v** | Reaction rate (μmol · min⁻¹) | Speedometer needle |
| **V<sub>max</sub>** | Top speed when enzyme is saturated | Car’s max speed in 5th gear |
| **K<sub>m</sub>** | Substrate concentration at ½ V<sub>max</sub> | How much throttle before cruising |
| **k<sub>cat</sub>** | Turnover per enzyme per second | Cylinders firing per second |
| **k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub>** | Catalytic efficiency | km · L⁻¹ · s⁻¹ fuel economy |

<Callout type="tip">
*Fly context:* wild-type **Alcohol dehydrogenase** has *k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub>* ≈ 6 × 10⁴ M⁻¹ s⁻¹.  
Fast allele raises that to 1.2 × 10⁵ — double efficiency explains faster ethanol detox.

## 3 Classic Michaelis–Menten workflow ☑️

| Step | Bench action | Quick code (Python) |
|------|--------------|---------------------|
| **1 · Prep** | Clarify larval homogenate, measure protein | `mg_prot = BCA(lysate)` |
| **2 · Substrate series** | 0.1 → 10 × expected K<sub>m</sub> | `S = np.logspace(-1,1,12)` |
| **3 · Start reaction** | Add NAD⁺, read A₃₄₀ every 10 s | `rates = slope(OD, t)` |
| **4 · Fit curve** | Non-linear regression to M–M | `Km, Vmax = curve_fit(mm, S, rates)` |
| **5 · Validate** | Lineweaver–Burk or Eadie–Hofstee plot | `plot(1/S, 1/rate)` |

## 4 Interpreting the curves 👀

### 4.1  Hyperbolic plot  
Looks like oxygen binding curve – plateau = V<sub>max</sub>.

### 4.2  Lineweaver–Burk double-reciprocal  
Straight line; intercepts give K<sub>m</sub> & V<sub>max</sub>.  
⚠️ Amplifies error at low substrate – use only for visual check.

### 4.3  Competitive vs non-competitive inhibition  
Adding *4-methylpyrazole* (competitive) **raises apparent K<sub>m</sub>**,
V<sub>max</sub> unchanged.  
Adding heavy-metal ion (non-competitive) **drops V<sub>max</sub>**, K<sub>m</sub> same.

## 5 Common pitfalls 🛑

* **Substrate depletion** – keep turnover < 10 % or v₀ isn’t “initial”.  
* **Dead-time reading** – manual mix → spectro start delay skews first points.  
* **Enzyme instability** – freeze–thaw Adh cuts V<sub>max</sub> in half; prepare fresh.  
* **Product inhibition** – lactate DH generates NADH that feeds back; include coupling enzyme.

## 6 Quick-start code snippet 🐍

```python
from kmfit import fit_mm
# S = substrate μM, v = ΔA/min converted to μM/min
Km, Vmax = fit_mm(S, v)
print(f"Km = {Km:.2f} μM ; Vmax = {Vmax:.1f} μmol/min")
```

## In-lab checklist ✅

- Blank the plate reader with buffer + NAD⁺ only.

- Run triplicates per [S].

- Use ≤10 µg protein per well to avoid turbidity.

- Keep assay at 25 °C; K<sub>m</sub> shifts with temperature.

## 8 Take-home 🎯

- K<sub>m</sub> measures affinity (low is tight binding),
V<sub>max</sub> measures capacity.

- Always validate fits with a secondary plot (Lineweaver or Eadie).

- Report k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub> when comparing mutant vs wild-type alleles.
